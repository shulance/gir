# GIR

## Who is GIR?

GIR is the BV TS EMEA chatbot. GIR is actually a version of [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/), which is written in CoffeeScript on Node.js, and deployed on Heroku.

This repos has been created so EMEA team members can contribute new scripts to GIR to help increase (or decrease) productivity of the team.

## Contributing to GIR

All of GIR's scripts are written in CoffeeScript, which is a high level implemenation of JavaScript. Check this [information on scripting](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md) or just have a look at some of simple [scripts](https://github.com/shulance/gir/tree/master/scripts) GIR already uses.

To add your own script to GIR you should fork this repository and add your script to the `scripts` directory. You can get a version of hubot running on your local environment by following [these instructions](https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs) so you can test your script locally. If it works, create a pull request to original repository so it can be deployed to Heroku!

Happy scripting!
